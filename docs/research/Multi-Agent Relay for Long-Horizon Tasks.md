# **System Design Document: Transitioning to the Multi-Agent Verification Loop for Long-Horizon Coherence**

## **I. Strategic Rationale: Architecting Long-Horizon Coherence**

### **A. The Fragility of the Monolithic MCP Loop and the Coherence Problem**

The architectural pivot from a single monolithic LLM toolchain, referred to as the MCP (Monolithic Coherence Problem) loop, to a distributed multi-agent system is motivated by the fundamental limitations of handling long-horizon tasks within a single, expanding context window. The original system architecture (LLM $\\rightarrow$ RAG/LanceDB $\\rightarrow$ LM Studio $\\rightarrow$ Custom App Input) typically suffers from a critical failure mode known as the Coherence Problem. In this scenario, the singular agent attempts to maintain an unbounded memory of all prior actions, observations, and generated artifacts.1

As tasks accumulate over prolonged execution times—often exceeding a few minutes—the inference cost of the transformer scales prohibitively with context length. Furthermore, the sheer volume of information dilutes the relevant details, causing the model to become distracted by outdated or extraneous information.1 This phenomenon causes the agent to "spin out," lose track of its original goal, and generate inconsistent outputs. For projects requiring runtimes of 200+ minutes or designed to operate "endlessly," this architectural fragility necessitates a radical shift.

### **B. The Verification Loop (V-Loop) Solution**

The strategic response to the Coherence Problem is the implementation of the Verification Loop (V-Loop) or "Relay Race" architecture. This design enforces modularity by breaking down the complex, long-horizon goal into a series of short, verified sprints.2 This approach fundamentally addresses context inflation by resetting the agent's active context after each sprint, ensuring that only a condensed summary of the necessary state is carried forward.3

The constraint of time slicing the Builder agent to a maximum of 15–20 minutes and the Verifier agent to 5–10 minutes is not merely a performance guideline; it is a compulsory mechanism for *forced context compaction*. The physical time limit guarantees that the agent cannot generate an unbounded history. Should a sprint approach its expiration timer, the Central Scheduler is designed to trigger a state compression function, regardless of immediate task completion, thereby ensuring that the state passed to the next component is maximally condensed and retains only critical information, such as project intent and known issues.5 This proactive approach avoids the high-cost, low-accuracy performance regime associated with context dilution.1

### **C. Architectural Choice: Graph-Based Orchestration for Cycles**

To manage the deterministic flow and iterative refinement required by the V-Loop, the orchestration framework must support cycles, conditional logic, and robust state management. LangGraph is selected as the optimal framework, as it emphasizes workflow structure and allows for the creation of cycling graphs and conditional edges.6 This capability is indispensable for the "Verify $\\rightarrow$ Fail $\\rightarrow$ Remediate" cycle, where the system must route execution back to a builder upon finding a defect, or forward to the next task upon success.

This graph-based approach contrasts with architectures focused primarily on conversational agent interactions (like AutoGen) or strict hierarchical delegation (like CrewAI), making LangGraph superior for formalizing the state-dependent control flow of a robust verification system.8 The multi-agent architecture necessitates abstracting the original monolithic tooling. Functions previously handled by a single LLM (planning, execution, self-critique) are now decoupled into specialized agent roles (Builder/Planner, Verifier/Critique, Scheduler/Orchestration).9 This enforced separation enhances reliability, as tool permissions (e.g., only the Verifier can run tests; only the Builder can write to the workspace) are strictly bound to their respective roles, reducing security risks and potential failure modes.11

## **II. Definitive Agent Roles and Tooling Integration**

The Relay Race architecture relies on defining explicit, non-overlapping roles for the agents, accessed via standardized API contracts to ensure system modularity and scalability.

### **A. The Builder Agent: Protocol and Bounded Task Execution**

The Builder Agent serves as the execution engine for the current, bounded task sprint. Its primary responsibility is to accept a concise prompt—the Handoff Baton—which includes a segment of the project roadmap, the compressed task state (Synopsis), and potentially a Defect Capsule if it is a remediation sprint. The Builder's objective is to translate this input into actionable work and verifiable artifacts, such as code changes, data migrations, or documentation updates.12

The LLM inference component, currently LM Studio, is repurposed from a monolithic service into a specialized inference server. The orchestration layer accesses the Builder through a dedicated, lightweight HTTP API endpoint, decoupling the agent's *role* from its underlying *model implementation*.13

#### **Builder Agent API Service Definition**

* **Endpoint:** The communication occurs via a dedicated endpoint, such as builder\_agent.run\_iteration.  
* **Input Payload (Handoff Baton):** This structured input contains the Condensed State, the specific Roadmap Chunk currently being addressed, and the Defect Capsule (if triggered by a failure).  
* **Output Payload (Artifact Package):** The Builder must return its output in a standardized, machine-readable format. This package includes a Structured Changelog, the Patch Bundle (the actual code/artifact changes), suggested next steps for the roadmap, and the Builder Summary (a new State Synopsis for the next cycle).

The requirement for dedicated API endpoints for each agent role (e.g., builder\_agent.run\_iteration) is foundational to the system's resilience. If the underlying LM Studio model is replaced—for instance, switching from a locally hosted Qwen model to a remote proprietary model via an OpenAI API 15—the Central Scheduler only needs to update the endpoint URL. The core workflow logic of the V-Loop remains undisturbed. This adherence to standardized API contracts (like A2A or OpenAPI) ensures portability and vendor neutrality, future-proofing the architecture against model changes.11

### **B. The Verifier Agent: Automation, Validation, and Critique**

The Verifier Agent acts as the indispensable quality gate. Its role is to immediately pick up the Builder's output (the Artifact Package) and attempt to prove the absence of defects against the specified roadmap chunk and project standards.16

#### **Tool Integration and LLM-Based Critique**

The Verifier is granted access to specialized tools, such as the existing proprietary execution framework (runSpecKitAutomation). These tools are exposed as function calls to the Verifier agent, allowing it to execute automated regression tests, linting checks, and style adherence checks against the Builder's generated code.12

Crucially, the Verifier must move beyond passive static checks. It performs an active, qualitative critique, functioning as an "LLM-as-a-Judge".12 This involves reasoning over the Builder's summary, the original goal, and the objective test results to check for subtle logical errors or requirement deviations that automated tests might miss.16

The Verifier's output is the definitive Verifier Verdict (PASS/FAIL). To ensure the Verifier itself is trustworthy, the system must incorporate redundant verification pathways.18 This involves confirming that the static test results (runSpecKitAutomation) align with the LLM's qualitative critique. Only when the agent successfully runs all scripted checks *and* the LLM deems the solution logically sound against the intent is the Verdict determined to be PASS. Upon determining a failure, the Verifier’s most critical task is constructing the highly structured **Defect Capsule**—the core input for the remediation loop.

## **III. Structured State Management: The Handoff Protocol**

Reliability in multi-agent systems is heavily dependent on the quality of handoffs.11 To maintain long-horizon coherence, the system must use explicit, schema-validated data structures, collectively termed the "Baton," rather than relying on ambiguous free-form prose.

### **A. Context Compression: Crafting the "State Synopsis"**

The State Synopsis is the high-level summary designed to maintain project continuity across sprints without suffering from context window inflation.3 It is critical because it replaces the entire preceding conversation history, keeping the token count bounded and inference costs manageable.1

The generation of the Synopsis must employ sophisticated compression techniques, specifically **Hierarchical Summarization** and **Intent Preservation**.5 The LLM is strictly instructed to distill detailed facts into a concise, paragraph-level narrative, ideally limited to 50–75 tokens. This synopsis must clearly articulate: 1\) What core requirements were completed in the last sprint, 2\) Which key files or artifacts were touched, and 3\) The next immediate objective from the roadmap. By enforcing a compact, structured narrative, the system ensures that only the highest-value information—the core project intent and recent progress—is carried forward, optimizing token usage for maximum relevance.5

### **B. Designing the "Defect Capsule" Schema for Actionable Remediation**

The Defect Capsule is the mechanism by which failure feedback is transformed from a generic bug report into a prescriptive, actionable prompt for the next Builder Agent. The use of structured output, enforced via Pydantic models or JSON schemas, is essential because it allows the subsequent agent to parse the defect programmatically.19 This prevents the LLM from including superfluous reasoning or conversational detritus in the failure report, focusing the remediation effort precisely.

The Verifier Agent is mandated to populate the following schema upon failure:

Defect Capsule Schema (Pydantic/JSON Enforced)

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| defect\\\_id | String | Unique ID tied to the current sprint for tracking. |
| defect\\\_severity | Enum (Critical, Major, Minor, Style) | Prioritization metric for remediation. |
| defect\\\_location | String (File path, line range) | Precise location of the fault in the repository. |
| defect\\\_type | String (e.g., TestFailure, LintError, LogicDrift) | Categorization of the failure mode. |
| root\\\_cause\\\_synopsis | Text | LLM-generated analysis of *why* the bug occurred. |
| prescriptive\\\_fix\\\_steps | List of Strings | Short, actionable commands for the next Builder. |
| repro\\\_steps\\\_script | Text | Script snippet or command sequence to reproduce the failure. |
| vector\\\_key | String | Index key for semantic memory insertion and RAG retrieval. |

This enforced structure ensures high-quality input for the remediation loop. Specifically, the root\_cause\_synopsis field is highly valuable, representing a clean data point concerning a real-world system failure. By immediately embedding this synopsis and storing it in the persistent memory layer (Section V), the system proactively builds a high-value dataset for future learning and defect prevention.21

## **IV. The Coordination Loop and Resilient Scheduling**

### **A. The Central Scheduler: Responsibility and Time Enforcement**

The Central Scheduler serves as the orchestrator, managing the flow of state through the LangGraph, enforcing time budgets, and determining the routing to the next agent node (Builder, Verifier, or Human).10

The Scheduler’s primary mechanism for achieving coherence is the strict enforcement of time slicing.2 Hard timeouts (e.g., 20 minutes for the Builder) are implemented. If an agent exceeds its budget, the Scheduler forces an interrupt, compresses the current state (marking the sprint as a technical failure if necessary), and queues remediation. This deterministic enforcement prevents resource drift and ensures that the system does not enter unproductive, endless loops.22

### **B. The Graph Flow: Implementing Conditional Edges**

The V-Loop is implemented using a cyclic LangGraph structure, where transitions are governed by conditional edges based on the Verifier's output and the current state of the remediation count.6 This deterministic control is crucial for maintaining operational integrity over long horizons.

The core nodes of the graph include BUILDER\\\_SPRINT, VERIFIER\\\_VALIDATE, SCHEDULER\\\_DECIDE, HUMAN\\\_ESCALATE, and END\\\_SPRINT. The SCHEDULER\\\_DECIDE node handles the conditional routing, which is based on the system’s predefined resilience policy.

V-Loop State Transition Logic

| Current State | Verifier Verdict | Remediation Count | Scheduler Action | Next Agent Input |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| BUILDER\_SPRINT | FAIL | \< 2 | Route to BUILDER\_SPRINT | Previous Synopsis \+ Defect Capsule |
| BUILDER\_SPRINT | FAIL | $\\ge 2$ | Route to HUMAN\_ESCALATE | Conversation Trail \+ Latest Capsule |
| BUILDER\_SPRINT | PASS | Any | Route to END\_SPRINT | Next Roadmap Goal \+ New Synopsis |
| END\_SPRINT | N/A | N/A | Queue Next Item / Halt | N/A |

### **C. Circuit Breakers and Escalation Policy**

A resilient system requires defined points where automation cedes control to human experts. The Circuit Breaker logic is implemented to detect non-recoverable failures, defined primarily as repeated, identical failures (tracked by comparing the content hash of consecutive Defect Capsules) or repeated timeouts.18

If the Verifier fails twice on the same condensed bug report (Remediation Count $\\ge 2$), the system shifts to the Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) escalation protocol.23 The Scheduler immediately pauses execution and compiles the compressed conversation trail—the sequence of State Synopses and Defect Capsules leading to the failure—for the maintainer. This complete, auditable log ensures that the human operator receives maximum context with minimum noise, preventing manual debugging delays.

The graph structure also inherently enables precise cost modeling. By instrumenting monitoring (via structured logs) at each graph node, the system tracks granular metrics such as tokens used, inference cost, and runtime latency per sprint.22 This data, logged in the Task Ledger, provides empirical evidence for continuous optimization of prompt templates or model hyperparameters. Furthermore, successful iteration relies on robust checkpointing. Upon success, the Verifier must emit a **Signed Checkpoint** (containing the commit hash and test proof), which the Scheduler logs to the persistent Task Ledger. This ensures that the system can reliably resume execution from the last validated, consistent state, regardless of subsequent crashes.6

## **V. Memory Subsystem: LanceDB for Durable Coherence**

### **A. Dual Function: LanceDB as the Unified Agent Memory Layer**

Long-term coherence requires a robust memory subsystem capable of handling both structured and vector data. LanceDB, an open-source AI-Native Multimodal Lakehouse, is the chosen solution.25 It supports the necessary duality: structured logging of operational progress and failures (the Task Ledger) and semantic retrieval of past context for failure remediation (Agentic RAG).26

It is essential to decouple memory types. Short-term context (the Handoff Baton, actively processed by the current agents) is isolated from Durable Memory (LanceDB). This separation prevents the active, limited context window from being cluttered with historical data, which is instead accessed only on demand via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).11

The file-based nature of LanceDB significantly simplifies operational complexity. It allows the Scheduler to spin up isolated memory stores for every running long-horizon project or parallel test instance.26 This isolation prevents memory or defect history from cross-contaminating different agent contexts, a critical concern in scaling complex multi-agent workflows.

### **B. Designing the "Task Ledger" Schema**

The Task Ledger is the definitive, auditable record of the long-horizon project, stored persistently in LanceDB. It serves as the single source of truth for checkpointing, auditing, and generating the necessary training data for RAG.

Proposed Task Ledger Schema (LanceDB/SQLite)

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| task\\\_id | String (PK) | Unique identifier for the long-horizon project. |
| sprint\\\_id | Integer | Iteration number for chronological retrieval. |
| road\\\_map\\\_chunk | Text | The specific goal segment attempted. |
| builder\\\_summary | Text | Agent-generated state synopsis paragraph. |
| verifier\\\_verdict | Boolean | PASS/FAIL determination. |
| defect\\\_capsule\\\_json | JSON/Text | Full structured bug report (if FAIL). |
| artifacts\\\_commit\\\_sha | String | Git hash of code changes (Signed Checkpoint). |
| tokens\\\_used\\\_builder | Integer | Cost and complexity metric for the sprint. |
| runtime\\\_minutes | Float | Time slicing enforcement tracking. |
| timestamp\\\_end | Timestamp | Completion time for auditing/latency tracking. |
| issue\\\_vector | Vector (float) | Semantic embedding of the defect/summary for RAG retrieval. |

### **C. RAG for Remediation: Leveraging Semantic Search on Defect History**

The V-Loop system leverages an advanced application of RAG, specifically **Agentic RAG**, to enable agents to actively learn from their past failures.28 This process transforms the Task Ledger from a static log into an active organizational knowledge base.

#### **The Remediation Retrieval Pipeline (Failure Path)**

1. **Vector Generation:** When the Verifier generates a Defect Capsule, the root\_cause\_synopsis is immediately passed to an embedding model to generate the issue\_vector. This vector is then stored alongside the structured data in the LanceDB Task Ledger.27  
2. **Semantic Query:** If the Scheduler determines the next step is a remediation sprint, the incoming Defect Capsule is used as the query text.31 The Builder's pre-processing step executes a vector search against the LanceDB memory collection.32  
3. **Context Injection:** The search specifically retrieves defect\_capsule\_json entries that are semantically similar to the current defect *but have a historical verifier\_verdict of TRUE* (i.e., successfully resolved issues).21  
4. **Proactive Prevention:** The retrieved, resolved fix patterns are injected into the Builder's prompt as In-Context Learning. This guides the remediation agent on established, successful repair strategies, preventing the re-opening of previously solved bugs and significantly accelerating the failure recovery process.

Finally, this structured, verified ledger data serves a secondary, high-value purpose: it constitutes a clean, labeled corpus (input prompt, agent action, outcome PASS/FAIL) that researchers can extract.25 This operational data allows for the continuous fine-tuning of the base LLM, creating specialized models that excel at handling remediation cycles and further improving the long-horizon accuracy of the overall system.1

## **VI. Conclusion and Implementation Roadmap**

### **A. Synthesis of Architectural Reliability Gains**

The transition from the monolithic MCP loop to the multi-agent Verification Loop represents a fundamental shift toward scalable, reliable AI automation. The Relay Race model effectively replaces centralized, failure-prone execution with a decentralized system of verified, bounded sprints, directly solving the context coherence problem that previously plagued long-horizon tasks.

The system's reliability is ensured by enforced time-slicing (acting as a context compaction mechanism), strict API contracts for specialized agent roles, and the structured Defect Capsule schema, which transforms vague errors into prescriptive inputs for self-correction. Long-horizon coherence is achieved not by perpetually maintaining a massive context window, but by leveraging structured state compression (State Synopsis) and Agentic RAG, allowing the system to learn from and avoid past failures using durable, semantically indexed memory in LanceDB. The graph-based coordination loop provides auditable checkpointing and deterministic routing logic, guaranteeing system recovery from the last known successful state.

### **B. Next Steps for Orchestrator Modification**

To begin the implementation of this V-Loop architecture, the following steps must be executed:

1. **Orchestrator Framework Installation:** Implement the core V-Loop state machine using LangGraph to manage the nodes (BUILDER\\\_SPRINT, VERIFIER\\\_VALIDATE) and the conditional state transitions (Success, Failure, Escalation).7  
2. **API Service Development:** Develop lightweight, dedicated HTTP endpoints (builder\\\_agent.run\\\_iteration, verifier\\\_agent.validate) to abstract the underlying LM Studio and tooling implementation. These endpoints must strictly adhere to predefined input/output schemas.13  
3. **Schema Definition:** Formalize the Pydantic schemas for the State Synopsis and the Defect Capsule. These schemas must be strictly enforced via the LLM's structured output capabilities (e.g., JSON mode) to ensure reliable agent communication.19  
4. **LanceDB Integration:** Establish the LanceDB Task Ledger structure, ensuring that the necessary pipeline components (embedding model) are integrated to generate and store issue\\\_vectors. This activates the Agentic RAG subsystem for remediation.27  
5. **Scheduler Logic Implementation:** Program the Scheduler component to enforce hard time-slicing limits and implement the conditional routing logic, including the Circuit Breaker mechanism for HIL escalation, as detailed in Section IV.
